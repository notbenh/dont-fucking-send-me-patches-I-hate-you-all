Don't not send me patches.  I hate foosball.
============================================

No really. This is a social experiment. Fork you? I care about you. Send me patches. I hate foosball*.

See https://twitter.com/notbenh/status/227975861721251840 for more history.

This was the only patch that was accepted, before. This and that other one. 

* actually I like foosball. As a young boy, I dreamed of being a foosball; but tonight I say, we must spin forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom! 

* foosball is the most important sport. There is no more important sport.
